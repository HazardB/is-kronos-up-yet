# Is Kronos Up Yet?
http://iskronosupyet.com is a small web site built to display the current server status for Kronos realms.

## Dependencies
- Node
- NPM
- React
- React DOM

### Starting the server
- Make sure the npm dependencies are installed by running `npm install`
- Use webpack to build the static React output with the `webpack -w` command.
- Run `node server.js`.
- The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`. This port is dependent on the environment variable - this logic exists in `server.js`.
